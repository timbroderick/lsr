# Learning statistics with R
=============================

This is my repository for the work I'll while I go through [Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners.](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/)

Resources and more available [here](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/)

Mostly this is for review, and prepping for [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://github.com/timbroderick/learnstats)
